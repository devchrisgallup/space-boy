The objective for this game is to bet the alien ship to the end of the level and grab the space cube before the alien ship can.  There is currently one level. 

This game is in the early stages of development.  A menu system, enemies that attack the player, shots fired from the alien ship, and more levels just to name a few things that are in current development. 

##Controls
           Move: left and right arrow keys
           Jump: Spacebar
           Boost: up arrow key (subtracts away from your points earned)
           
##Play
May take a few seconds to load. http://chrisgalluptest.info/spaceboy/index.html


##Setup 
There is a little bit of setting up to do before you are able to run the game.  You will need a local web server if you want to develop on your local machine. There is a great tutorial for this on the Phaser website. http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started
